BIWOTT, Commissioner of Mines and Geology.Page: 1938GAZETTE NOTICE No. 5327THE WATER ACT (No. 8   42002) THE NATIONAL WATER SERVICES STRATEGY (NWSS) 2007-2015, MAY, 2007IN EXERCISE of the powers conferred by section   107   (2) of the Water Act, 2002, the Director of Water Services notifies for the information of the 'general public that the Minister for Water and Irrigation intends to publish a national water services strategy for the development, management and monitoring of water and sewerage services. In fulfillment of the provisions of section   49   of the Act, the Minister wishes to consult with the public on the contents of the draft strategy whose summary is set out below. The full text of the draft strategy may be obtained from www.watergo.ke 1. Summary of the National Water Services Strategy (NWSS) Water is the most important natural resource, indispensable for life and at the same time the backbone of growth and prosperity for mankind. According to' UNDP more people die of water related diseases than in military conflicts around the world. Funds invested in WSS will generate an economic benefit of between   3   and   34   times depending on the technology and specific condition on the ground. In Sub-Saharan African countries every year   5% of the national product is lost because of inadequate WSS service provision. It is recommended to raise the profile of WSS and target to spend a minimum of 1% (UNDP target] of the GDP annually on WSS. In Kenya the WSS situation is poor for a majority of people with on the overall, approximately   57% (KIHBS   2005/2006) of households using water from sources considered safe. Sustainable access to safe water is around   60% in the urban setting and drops to as low as   20% in the settlements of the urban poor where half of the urban population _ lives. With a population growth of up to   10% in the low income urban settlements many 'hot spots' continue to develop in many towns and therefore sustainable access to safe water is declining. Sustainable access to safe water in the rural setting is estimated at   40%. Sanitation coverage country wide is about   50%. Living conditions in the settlements of the urban poor are, appalling due to the resulting unsanitary environment. Missing sanitary installations and uncontrolled disposal of excreta pollutes the water sources from which most of the informal providers draw water. Vendors sell water of uncontrolled quality to consumers who have to spend hours to fetch it at prices that are often between   5   and   20   times the tariff applied on consumers with a metered water connection. The information presently available needs to be gradually improved and adjusted as and when more precise data becomes available through the information systems that are now being established. In the past performance of utilities was poor due to ineffective management and inadequate provision for operation and maintenance. The resulting poor performance has led to rapid degradation of WSS infrastructure hindering the desire to achieve self-sustainability impacting mainly on the low income consumers. Syndication of utilities into viable clusters and application of commercial principles has emerged as a powerful response to turn around this declining trend. It has led to improvements in performance and increase in investments for rehabilitation and establishment of new facilities. In order to tackle institutional and operational weaknesses, the Government through the MWI has commenced water sector reform provided for in the Water Act   2002. All the new institutions within the WSS sub-sector have been established: Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB) to set standards and regulate the sub-sector; Water Appeal Board (WAB) to adjudicate on disputes; seven Water Services Boards (WSBs) to   -be responsible for the efficient and economical provision of water services; Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF) to finance pro-poor investments; Water Services Providers (WSPs) to be agents in the provision of water and sewerage services utilizing acceptable business principles in their operations. The MWI is responsible for overall sector oversight including policy formulation, co-ordination and resource mobilisation. The NWSS defines the following strategic goals and strategic actions designed to provide an effective and efficient response to the challenges identified in the WSS sub-sector:   Strategic goalsStrategic actions2.1   Reach at least   50% of the underserved urban population with safe and affordable water by   2015   _ (MDG) and thereafter, move to access to all by   2030(a)Increasing sustainability anti benefits of economy of scale through clustering of utilities. (b)Review tariff guidelines periodically to cover justified costs. (c) Sector investments shall focus on infrastructure development ant' improvements of operation.

(b) Enhance the contribution of the water sector to basic sanitation by promoting integrated programmes that have a sanitation component. (c) Promote professionalis m and Minimum standards for basic sanitation through guidelines to enhance local level capacity. d) Fast tracking basic sanitation for the poor, through subsidies by GoK or DPs2.4   Achieve the MDG by fast tracking affordable and sustainable access to safe water in the settlements of the urban poor.(a) Ensure increased service provision in the settlements of the urban poor with minimum requirements and standards through GoK or DP subsidy in infrastructure development and empowering to manage facilities. (b) (b)Accelerate sustainable access to safe water in the settlements of , the urban poor by formalizing connections, setting pro-poor tariffs, providing appropriate outlets.

(d) (d)Water sector reports to include advances in service provision to urban poor. (e) (e)Institutional development aimed at building capacity to be prioritized to develop local level management of WS provision2.5   Reach at least   50% of the underserved in rural areas with safe and affordable water by   2015   (MDG) and thereafter move to sustainable access for all by   2030(a) Promote increase in investments and ownership for sustainable access to water in the rural areas. (b) Improve water quality of water sources by enforcing water quality standards and effective policing by WRMA etc. (c)Sustainability of rural water systems by promoting beneficiary participation in planning, implementation and management: (d)Enforcements of national standards and regulation.

It also requires the directors to ensure the Board maintains proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Board. The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Board. The directors accept the responsibility for the financial statements which have been prepared using appropriate accounting policies supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, consistent with previous years, and in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirement of the Banking Act (Cap.  488). The directors are of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the financial affairs of the Board as at  30  June  2007  and of its operating results for the year then ended. The directors further confirm the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records maintained by the Board which have been relied upon in the preparation of the financial statements as well as on the adequacy of the systems of internal financial controls. Nothing has come to the attention of the directors to indicate that the Board will not remain a going concern for at least the next twelve months from the date of this statement.

AWUONDO CHAIRMAN MEMBER REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DEPOSIT PROTECTION FUND BOARD REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Deposit Protection Fund Board set out on comprise the balance sheet as at  30th June, 2007  and the income and expenditure statement, statement of changes in fund balance and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The directors' are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Banking Act (Cap.  488). This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. AUDTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express an independent opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in-order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. OPINION In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of financial affairs of the Deposit Protection Fund Board as at  30th June, 2007  and of its surplus and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Banking Act (Cap.  488).

Interest income is recognized in the period in which it is earned based on the expired portion of the life of the investments it relates to. Interest is primarily earned on treasury bills and bonds and other interest carrying instruments. Discounts and premiums on acquisition of government securities are amortized over the life of the security. (c) Provisions for payments to depositors Provisions for payments to protected depositors are recognized in the financial statements in the period the contributory institutions are placed under liquidation. Any payments that exceed the provisions made are taken into account in determining operating profit. Provisions that relate to unclaimed protected deposits are written back to income on expiry of the statutory notice period. (d) Taxation The Board's income is not subject to tax as it has been granted exemption by the Commissioner of Income Tax. Therefore no provision for current tax or deferred tax is Made in the financial statements. (e) Property and equipment All property and equipment is initially recorded at cost and thereafter stated at historical cost less depreciation. Depreciation is calculated at rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets concerned over their expected useful lives on the reducing balance basis except for computers which are depreciated on the straight line basis.  The annual rates in use are:Rate  %Furniture and fittings12.50Office and kitchen equipment20.00Motor vehicles25.00Computers33.33  Leasehold buildings are written off over the estimated useful life of the building, or the remaining lease term, whichever is less. The assets useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are taken into account in determining operating profit. (f) Investment held for sale Investment held for sale relates to investment in subsidiary which is accounted for under IFRS  5  'Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations. The investment is stated at the lower of its carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Income2007 KSh.0002006 KSh.000la.

In the opinion of the directors, the additional dimunition in value of KSh.100,000  based on this valuation is not material for recognition in the financial statements. The Board owns  50.2% of the ordinary share capital of the Consolidated Bank of Kenya Limited. At the time of acquisition of the investment, the Banking Act allowed the Board to acquire, hold or dispose shares of an institution that would result in a loss to the Board. The Banking Act was later amended and now prevents the Board from holding investments other than in government securities. The Board has signed the agreement transferring the shareholding in Consolidated Bank Limited to Treasury for onward sale to third parties. The Treasury is in the process of finalizing the transfer Due to the above, the requirement for consolidation on IAS  27  does not apply.  9.

				Page: 4666GAZETTE NOTICE No. 12302THE INDUSTRIAL COURT OF KENYA CAUSE No. 106 OF 2006 TAILORS AND TEXTILE WORKERS UNION-(Claimant) AND EPZ APPARELS MANUFACTURERS AND EXPORTERS CROUP OP F.K.E-(Respondent)Issue in dispute: Refusal of the Management to review the CBA: House Allowance. Annual Leave. Sick leave. Redundancy. Gratuity. Death. Termination. Night Allowance.Basic Minimum Wage. General Wage Increase. Leave Travelling Allowance. Night Transport. Night Shift Allowance. Maternity Leave. The Tailors and Textile Workers Union represented by Mr. Wycliffe Omondi, shall hereinafter be referred to as "the Claimant", and Messrs. EPZ Apparels Manufacturers and Exporters Croup of FKE, represented by Mr.L.W. Kariuki shall hereinafter be referred to as "the Respondents". The parties were heard in Court at Nairobi on the  26th July, 11th and  28th September and lst November, 2007. They relied on their written memoranda, two witnesses testified and their representatives made oral submissions in support of their respective cases. AWARD jointly This Dispute was referred to the Court by the parties signing Form A  -  Notification of Dispute  -  Dated 11th October, 2006, in accordance with the provisions of section  14  (7) of the Trade Unions Act, Cap.234, hereinafter referred to as "the Act". This Form A together with the requisite statutory certificate, being Frorn G issued by the Labour Commissioner under the provisions of section  14  (9) (e) of the Act, were received by the Court on the 16th October. The matter was listed for mention in Court on the  7th November, when directions on filing of memoranda. compilation of a report on analysis of issues by the Economic Planning Division (EPD) and the hearing date were given. The Claimant filed its Memorandum of Claim on the  22nd November, while the Respondents filed a preliminary objection on l9th February,2007. The Economic Planning Division (EPD) filed its report on the  29th June. The Preliminary objection was argued on the 11th September. The representative of the Respondents urged the Court to strike out the Memorandum of Claim on the basis that the respondent Croup of Companies had not refused to review or negotiate the Collective Bargaining Agreement as averred since initially there were  28  iterns in dispute and that negotiation between the parties had reduced the disputed items to  14. It was further argued that the Clairnant was asking the Court to negotiate a Collective Agreement for it while this was not the function of the Court. The Court ruled that the dispute should be determined on merit and the Respondent was directed to file a substantive Memorandum of Reply, which was filed on  4th October. The Claimant had filed a Memorandum and called a witness, a Mr. James Otula Migwangi who used to work for Messrs. Rising Sun Limited, one of the EPZ Group of Companies. The representative also made fairly detailed oral submissions in support of his side. It is the position of the Claimant that there are seven (7) companies in the Respondent group. It is averred that the management of the Respondent group failed, neglected and/or refused to review the terms and conditions of the employees contained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which was to expire on  30th Septernber, 2005. A new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) should have commenced on lst October, 2005  but this was not to be due to the intransigence of the management. The Claimant had made proposals and handed them over but there was no agreement of the fourteen (14) items. Those proposals have been made into demands, which the Claimant Union now asks the Court to award as demanded, both in the Memorandum of Claim and in the oral submissions. lt was the evidence of the witness called by the Claimant that he worked for Messrs. Rising Sun Company between  2003  and September,2006; and also for Messrs. M.R.C Nairobi (EPZ) Limited between October and December, 2006. He stated that both Companies were in operation even by the time he was testifying. The Claimant had made demands upon the Respondent Croup on the Fourteen (14) items which will be examined in detail hereinafter but in sum, they seek enhancement and improvement upon the existing terms in the previous agreement. The Representative of Respondent relied on the Memorandum of Reply. The oral submission was reiterated of the averments made in the Memorandum. It was his case that there are five (5) and not seven (7) companies in the Respondent Group. According to him, two of the companies namely Messrs. Rising Sun Kenya, (EPZ) Ltd and Messrs.M.R.C Nairobi (EPZ).Limited have ceased operations. It was also his case that the remaining companies are not in a position to meet and satisfy the demands made by the Claimant due to poor financial performance arising from unfavorable economic conditions. The representative of the Respondents cited the unfair competition from importation from China and South East Asia countries, relocation of investors in the textile industry from Kenya, the erosion of the value of the American dollar resulting from strengthening of the Kenya currency among other reasons. The Respondent urged the Court to uphold the continuation of the terms and conditions contained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) expiring on  30th September, 2005. The Respondent thus resisted all the demands made by the Claimant and asked the Court to reject them. The Court had directed the Economic PLanning Division (EPZ) of the Ministry of Labouir to peruse the memoranda, to consult with the panies, to analyze the issues and to file a report of such analysis. A report was duly filed. An Official, Mr. Benson Okwayo testified and produced the report as Exhibition No. l. He was cross-examined by the representatives of both sides. They accepted the conclusions and analysis. It was a conclusion of the Economic Planning Division (EPD) thst the Respondent Group of companies have not been performing impressively. The EPD report analyzed five companies of the Respondent, namely: Mirage Fashion Wear (EPZ) Limited. Rolex Garments (EPZ) Limited, Global Appuels (EPZ) Limited. Protex (K) Limited, Altex (EPZ) Limited, The witness in making his analysis had also considered the Wages Guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance in 1973  and amended in 1994, and which are binding to the Court in accordance with the provisions of Section 14  (10) of the Trade Dispute Act. According to the analysis, the employees of the Respondent Group are in the Nairobi Lower Income Group. The cost of living index for the period of the previous Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that is, 1st October, 2003  and  30th September, 2005  had risen by  25,26, According to the Wages Guidelines these workers are entitled to compensation of  100  per cent for loss of purchasing power. This means that their salaries and Wages for the ensuing  period should rise by  12.63  per cent for each year, They would also be entitled to compensation in house allowance of  50  per cent of the rise in consumer price index (CPI), which would translate, to  12.63  per cent for the two years as from 1st October, 2005  up to  30th September, 2007, The analysis also shows that the five (5) companies were not doing well at all, and that for the period from the year  2003  up to 2006, four (4) of the Companies made net losses, and that only M/s Protex (K) Limited in the year  2005  made a profit of KSh. 253,999. It should also be observed that the period of the CBA, that is, lst October,2005  up to  30th September,2007  had already expired. There is no evidence that the two companies, namely, Messrs. Rising Sun and M.R,C Nairobi (EPZ) Limited have ceased operations. It is not enough to merely assert. A company in law is a legal person whose life commences with incorporation and ends upon dissolution which is a legal act whose evidence should be a deed of voluntary winding up or liquidation by judicial process. They are therefore deemed to be in operation and have employees working for them as stated by the Claimant, There is sufflclent evidence that the cost of living for Nairobi Lower Income Group of workers for the period under review, that is, from let October, 2005  up to  30th September, 2007  rose by  25.26  per cont, According to the Wages Guidelines, the workers are entitled to 100  per cent compcnsatlon for loss of purchasing power. The Guidelines are mandatory and their provisions are binding on this Court. It is  granted that the financial performance of the Respondent is not impressive, but this cannot be attributed to the workers, indeed, the analysis indicates that the deficits in the financial performance have been decreasing from the year  2003  up to  2006. The demand for  30  per cent increase for the lst year and  40  per cent lncrease for the  2nd year of the General Wage to the unionisable workers of the seven (7) companies for the period between lst October, 2005  up to  30th September,2007,The Claimant demands that the current house allowance rate of KSh. 750  be increased to KSh. 2,000  for the lst year and KSh. 3,000 in the second year. The Respondent has prayed for maintenance of the status quo. The Wages Guidelines entitles the workers to an increase of house allowance of one half of the CPI which translates to KSh. .845. This is the most reasonable amount bearing the cost of living index as well as the financial performance of the Respondent. lt is therefore awarded accordingly, The Claimant Union has made demands on twelve (12) other items including leave traveling allowance, night shift allowance, and basic minimum wage, death of an employee, night transport redundancy and termination of employment. It is evident that the period of the collective agreement in respect of which the demands are made has expired. It is also evident that the Respondent companies have not been doing well. It would be prudent if the Claimant Union and the management of the Respondent Group of Companies were to be engaged in the negotiation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) for the current period from lst October, 2007  up to  30th September,2009. lt is therefore the decision of this court to decline to award on those items and hereby directs the panies to proceed to negotiate the same and conclude such CBA within the next six (6) months to enable the workers to benefit. The argument that the employer is unable to meet such demands due to poor financial performance of any other reason is without merit because no employer needs to employ workers, which it cannot pay. There are other options. ln the circumstances, the Court awards that the Respondent to calculate and pay to their unionisable employees their benefits under General Wage Increment and house allowance to which they are entitled due to this award which grants them an increase of  25  per cent for General Wage and 12  per cent for house allowance for the period from 1st October, 2005  up to  30th September, 2007. These payments to be made within Six (6) months, The Claimant Union is to make the calculations and deliver them to the Respondent within  30  days and if the latter disputes them, the head of the Economic Planning Division or a representative appointed by him to make the calculations, The calculations once served upon the Respondent are to be part and parcel of this award, and the dues to be paid as said within Six (6) months.

Annual Leave. Sick leave. Redundancy. Gratuity. Death. Termination. Night Allowance.Basic Minimum Wage. General Wage Increase. Leave Travelling Allowance. Night Transport. Night Shift Allowance. Maternity Leave. The Tailors and Textile Workers Union represented by Mr. Wycliffe Omondi, shall hereinafter be referred to as "the Claimant", and Messrs. EPZ Apparels Manufacturers and Exporters Croup of FKE, represented by Mr.L.W. Kariuki shall hereinafter be referred to as "the Respondents". The parties were heard in Court at Nairobi on the  26th July, 11th and  28th September and lst November, 2007. They relied on their written memoranda, two witnesses testified and their representatives made oral submissions in support of their respective cases. AWARD jointly This Dispute was referred to the Court by the parties signing Form A  -  Notification of Dispute  -  Dated 11th October, 2006, in accordance with the provisions of section  14  (7) of the Trade Unions Act, Cap.234, hereinafter referred to as "the Act". This Form A together with the requisite statutory certificate, being Frorn G issued by the Labour Commissioner under the provisions of section  14  (9) (e) of the Act, were received by the Court on the 16th October. The matter was listed for mention in Court on the  7th November, when directions on filing of memoranda. compilation of a report on analysis of issues by the Economic Planning Division (EPD) and the hearing date were given. The Claimant filed its Memorandum of Claim on the  22nd November, while the Respondents filed a preliminary objection on l9th February,2007. The Economic Planning Division (EPD) filed its report on the  29th June. The Preliminary objection was argued on the 11th September. The representative of the Respondents urged the Court to strike out the Memorandum of Claim on the basis that the respondent Croup of Companies had not refused to review or negotiate the Collective Bargaining Agreement as averred since initially there were  28  iterns in dispute and that negotiation between the parties had reduced the disputed items to  14. It was further argued that the Clairnant was asking the Court to negotiate a Collective Agreement for it while this was not the function of the Court. The Court ruled that the dispute should be determined on merit and the Respondent was directed to file a substantive Memorandum of Reply, which was filed on  4th October. The Claimant had filed a Memorandum and called a witness, a Mr. James Otula Migwangi who used to work for Messrs. Rising Sun Limited, one of the EPZ Group of Companies. The representative also made fairly detailed oral submissions in support of his side. It is the position of the Claimant that there are seven (7) companies in the Respondent group. It is averred that the management of the Respondent group failed, neglected and/or refused to review the terms and conditions of the employees contained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which was to expire on  30th Septernber, 2005. A new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) should have commenced on lst October, 2005  but this was not to be due to the intransigence of the management. The Claimant had made proposals and handed them over but there was no agreement of the fourteen (14) items. Those proposals have been made into demands, which the Claimant Union now asks the Court to award as demanded, both in the Memorandum of Claim and in the oral submissions. lt was the evidence of the witness called by the Claimant that he worked for Messrs. Rising Sun Company between  2003  and September,2006; and also for Messrs. M.R.C Nairobi (EPZ) Limited between October and December, 2006. He stated that both Companies were in operation even by the time he was testifying. The Claimant had made demands upon the Respondent Croup on the Fourteen (14) items which will be examined in detail hereinafter but in sum, they seek enhancement and improvement upon the existing terms in the previous agreement. The Representative of Respondent relied on the Memorandum of Reply. The oral submission was reiterated of the averments made in the Memorandum. It was his case that there are five (5) and not seven (7) companies in the Respondent Group. According to him, two of the companies namely Messrs. Rising Sun Kenya, (EPZ) Ltd and Messrs.M.R.C Nairobi (EPZ).Limited have ceased operations. It was also his case that the remaining companies are not in a position to meet and satisfy the demands made by the Claimant due to poor financial performance arising from unfavorable economic conditions. The representative of the Respondents cited the unfair competition from importation from China and South East Asia countries, relocation of investors in the textile industry from Kenya, the erosion of the value of the American dollar resulting from strengthening of the Kenya currency among other reasons. The Respondent urged the Court to uphold the continuation of the terms and conditions contained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) expiring on  30th September, 2005. The Respondent thus resisted all the demands made by the Claimant and asked the Court to reject them. The Court had directed the Economic PLanning Division (EPZ) of the Ministry of Labouir to peruse the memoranda, to consult with the panies, to analyze the issues and to file a report of such analysis. A report was duly filed. An Official, Mr. Benson Okwayo testified and produced the report as Exhibition No. l. He was cross-examined by the representatives of both sides. They accepted the conclusions and analysis. It was a conclusion of the Economic Planning Division (EPD) thst the Respondent Group of companies have not been performing impressively. The EPD report analyzed five companies of the Respondent, namely: Mirage Fashion Wear (EPZ) Limited. Rolex Garments (EPZ) Limited, Global Appuels (EPZ) Limited. Protex (K) Limited, Altex (EPZ) Limited, The witness in making his analysis had also considered the Wages Guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance in 1973  and amended in 1994, and which are binding to the Court in accordance with the provisions of Section 14  (10) of the Trade Dispute Act. According to the analysis, the employees of the Respondent Group are in the Nairobi Lower Income Group. The cost of living index for the period of the previous Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that is, 1st October, 2003  and  30th September, 2005  had risen by  25,26, According to the Wages Guidelines these workers are entitled to compensation of  100  per cent for loss of purchasing power. This means that their salaries and Wages for the ensuing  period should rise by  12.63  per cent for each year, They would also be entitled to compensation in house allowance of  50  per cent of the rise in consumer price index (CPI), which would translate, to  12.63  per cent for the two years as from 1st October, 2005  up to  30th September, 2007, The analysis also shows that the five (5) companies were not doing well at all, and that for the period from the year  2003  up to 2006, four (4) of the Companies made net losses, and that only M/s Protex (K) Limited in the year  2005  made a profit of KSh. 253,999. It should also be observed that the period of the CBA, that is, lst October,2005  up to  30th September,2007  had already expired. There is no evidence that the two companies, namely, Messrs. Rising Sun and M.R,C Nairobi (EPZ) Limited have ceased operations. It is not enough to merely assert. A company in law is a legal person whose life commences with incorporation and ends upon dissolution which is a legal act whose evidence should be a deed of voluntary winding up or liquidation by judicial process. They are therefore deemed to be in operation and have employees working for them as stated by the Claimant, There is sufflclent evidence that the cost of living for Nairobi Lower Income Group of workers for the period under review, that is, from let October, 2005  up to  30th September, 2007  rose by  25.26  per cont, According to the Wages Guidelines, the workers are entitled to 100  per cent compcnsatlon for loss of purchasing power. The Guidelines are mandatory and their provisions are binding on this Court. It is  granted that the financial performance of the Respondent is not impressive, but this cannot be attributed to the workers, indeed, the analysis indicates that the deficits in the financial performance have been decreasing from the year  2003  up to  2006. The demand for  30  per cent increase for the lst year and  40  per cent lncrease for the  2nd year of the General Wage to the unionisable workers of the seven (7) companies for the period between lst October, 2005  up to  30th September,2007,The Claimant demands that the current house allowance rate of KSh. 750  be increased to KSh. 2,000  for the lst year and KSh. 3,000 in the second year. The Respondent has prayed for maintenance of the status quo. The Wages Guidelines entitles the workers to an increase of house allowance of one half of the CPI which translates to KSh. .845. This is the most reasonable amount bearing the cost of living index as well as the financial performance of the Respondent. lt is therefore awarded accordingly, The Claimant Union has made demands on twelve (12) other items including leave traveling allowance, night shift allowance, and basic minimum wage, death of an employee, night transport redundancy and termination of employment. It is evident that the period of the collective agreement in respect of which the demands are made has expired. It is also evident that the Respondent companies have not been doing well. It would be prudent if the Claimant Union and the management of the Respondent Group of Companies were to be engaged in the negotiation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) for the current period from lst October, 2007  up to  30th September,2009. lt is therefore the decision of this court to decline to award on those items and hereby directs the panies to proceed to negotiate the same and conclude such CBA within the next six (6) months to enable the workers to benefit. The argument that the employer is unable to meet such demands due to poor financial performance of any other reason is without merit because no employer needs to employ workers, which it cannot pay. There are other options. ln the circumstances, the Court awards that the Respondent to calculate and pay to their unionisable employees their benefits under General Wage Increment and house allowance to which they are entitled due to this award which grants them an increase of  25  per cent for General Wage and 12  per cent for house allowance for the period from 1st October, 2005  up to  30th September, 2007. These payments to be made within Six (6) months, The Claimant Union is to make the calculations and deliver them to the Respondent within  30  days and if the latter disputes them, the head of the Economic Planning Division or a representative appointed by him to make the calculations, The calculations once served upon the Respondent are to be part and parcel of this award, and the dues to be paid as said within Six (6) months.
