Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)			
NRTIs block reverse transcriptase, an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itself.
Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)			
NNRTIs bind to and later alter reverse transcriptase, an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itself.
Protease Inhibitors (PIs)			
PIs block HIV protease, an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itself.
Fusion Inhibitors			
Fusion inhibitors block HIV from entering the CD4 cells of the immune system.
CCR5 Antagonists			
CCR5 antagonists block CCR5 coreceptors on the surface of certain immune cells that HIV needs to enter the cells.
Integrase Inhibitors			
Integrase inhibitors block HIV integrase, an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itself.
Post-Attachment Inhibitors			
Post-attachment inhibitors block CD4 receptors on the surface of certain immune cells that HIV needs to enter the cells.
Pharmacokinetic Enhancers			
Pharmacokinetic enhancers are used in HIV treatment to increase the effectiveness of an HIV medicine included in an HIV regimen.
